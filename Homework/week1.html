            <p>In a static website, the user just sends a simple query to get a website. Then the server retrieves the file from a storage device such as hard disk. Finally, the server returned the HTML file and the web browser display the information from that file. The look and feel are almost identical to eveyone in most cases.</p>
            <p>In a dynamic website, the user requests a website then the server recognize that must run dynamic script and create a customized version of the HTML file. Then returned that and the browser will display it. It could also send an additional request to the server like a Javascript and returned to the user customized information back once completed.</p>

            <p>Client-server model is when the client requests information to the server which process that request and then the server responded back to the client. This includes different types of servers like web, applicaiton, database, mail, media, or authentication servers among others. Always goes from clien to server and back to client.</p>
            <p>peer-to-peer models is when requests and responds are sent from different computers inside a particular group meaning transfer of information take place among them and is not restricted to a single direction back and for as in the case of client-server. Blockchain is an example of decentralized model like peer-to-peer.</p>
