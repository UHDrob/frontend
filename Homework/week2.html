            <h3>Describe the 4 layers in the four-layer network model</h3>
            <p> 
                <mark>Application Layer:</mark> higher protocols that allow applicaitons to interact with transport layers.   </p>
            <p>
                The application layer is the higherst layer in the TCP/IP model. Here it interacts with the user. For instance: web browsers, email, chat programs and others. Protocols: HTTP, SSH, FTP, POP/IMAP/SMTP, and DNS.
            </p>
            <p>
                <mark>Transport Layer:</mark> ensures transmissions arrive in order and without error. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It ensures that the applicaiton data is delivered to the receiving device in the correct order and without errors. Protocols: TCP and UDP
            </p>
            <p> 
                <mark>Internet Layer:</mark> establishes connection, routing, and addressing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It assigns an IP address to devices, and it is reponsible for establishing the connection between two end hosts and determine where the traffic should be sent. Protocols: IPv4 and IPv6.
            </p>

            <p> 
                <mark>Link Layer:</mark> resposible for physical transmission of raw bits.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Here the data is converted into digital signals that can be transmitted over copper wires or fiber optics. Protocol: MAX.
            </p>

            <h3>What does it mean browser rendering? Browser caching?</h3>
            <p>Browser rendering is when the browser interprets all HTML markup, with the images and information, into a grid of pixels to display within the browser window.</p>
            <p>Browser caching is saving the unchanged part of the website locally and only download what is new. The process speeds up the browser and reduce the network load.</p>

            <h3>In the url: http://www.uhd.edu, which are the protocol? How many domain-name level? What are they?</h3>
            <p>The protocol is <mark>HTTP</mark> Hypertext Transfer Protocol</p>
            <p>There are three domain name levels as follows</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Top-level domain</em> <strong>edu</strong></li>
                <li><em>Second-level domain</em> <strong>uhd</strong></li>
                <li><em>Third-level domain</em> <strong>www</strong></li>
