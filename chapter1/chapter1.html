            <p>Advantages of web applications:
                Accessible from any Internet-enable computer.
                Usable with diferent operating systems and browser applications.
                Easier to roll out program updates since only software on the server needs to be updated as opposed to every computer in the orgarnization using the software.
                Centrilized storage on the server means fewer security concerns about local storage.
            <p>Disadvantages</p>    
                Requirement to have an active Internet connection.
                Security concerns about sensitive private data being transmitted over the Internet.
                Concerns over the storage, licensing, and use of uploaded data.
                Problems wiht certain websites not having an identical appearance across all browsers.
                Restrictions on access to operating systems resources can prevent additional software from being installed and hardware from being accessed.

            <p>In the client-server model, there are two types of actors: clients and servers. The server is a computer agent taht is normally active 24/7, listening for requests and receives responses from the server, in the form of response codes, images, text files, and other data.</p>
            <p>In the peer-to-peer model each computer is functionally identical, each node is able tos end and receive data directly with one another.</p>
            <p class="question">Discuss the relationship between server farms, data centers, and Internet exchange points. Be sure to provide a definition for each.</p>
            <p>Server farms distribute incoming requests between clusters of machines so that any fiven web or data server is not excessively overloaded.</p>
            <p>Data centers will contain more than just computers and hard drives; sophisticated air conditioning systems, redundancy power systems using batteries and generators, specialized fire suppression systems, and security personnel are all part of a typical data center.</p>
            <p>Internet Exchange Points IXP allow different ISPs to peer(interconnect) with one another in a shared facility, thereby improving performance for each partner in the peer relationship.</p>
