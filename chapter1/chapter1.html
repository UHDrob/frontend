            <p class="question">What are the advantages of packet switching in comaprison to circuit switching?</p>
            <p>Packet switching is more reliable and robust solution where message is divided in packages that could be routed in different ways adding redundancy. Circuit switching got limited broadband and requires a direct unique connection.</p>
            <p class="question">What are the five essential elements of the early web that are still the core features of the modern web?</p>
            <p>TCP/IP, URL, HTTP, HTML, Browser</p>
            <p class="question">Describe the relative advantages and disadvantages of web-based applicaitons in comparison to traditional desktop applications</p>
            <p>Advantages of web applications:
                Accessible from any Internet-enable computer.
                Usable with diferent operating systems and browser applications.
                Easier to roll out program updates since only software on the server needs to be updated as opposed to every computer in the orgarnization using the software.
                Centrilized storage on the server means fewer security concerns about local storage.
            <p>Disadvantages</p>    
                Requirement to have an active Internet connection.
                Security concerns about sensitive private data being transmitted over the Internet.
                Concerns over the storage, licensing, and use of uploaded data.
                Problems wiht certain websites not having an identical appearance across all browsers.
                Restrictions on access to operating systems resources can prevent additional software from being installed and hardware from being accessed.
                Clients or their IT staff may have additional plugins added to their browsers, which provided added control over their browsing experience, but which might interfere with JavaScript, cookies, or advertisements.
            <p class="question">What is intranet?</p>
            <p>Internal network using Internet protocols that is local to an organization or business</p>
            <p class="question">What is a dynamic web page? How does it differ from a static page?</p>
            <p>Static page consist only of HTML pages that look identical for all users at all times.</p>
            <p>Dynamic server=side website is where the page content is being created at runtime by a program created by a programmer, this page content can vary fron user to user.</p>
            <p class="question">What does Web 2.0 refers to?</p>
            <p>For users, interactive experience where users could contribute and consume web content. For software developers, programming logic exits only on the servers.</p>
            <p class="question">What is the client-server model of communicaitons? How does it differ from peer-to-peer?</p>
            <p>In the client-server model, there are two types of actors: clients and servers. The server is a computer agent taht is normally active 24/7, listening for requests and receives responses from the server, in the form of response codes, images, text files, and other data.</p>
            <p>In the peer-to-peer model each computer is functionally identical, each node is able tos end and receive data directly with one another.</p>
            <p class="question">Discuss the relationship between server farms, data centers, and Internet exchange points. Be sure to provide a definition for each.</p>
            <p>Server farms distribute incoming requests between clusters of machines so that any fiven web or data server is not excessively overloaded.</p>
            <p>Data centers will contain more than just computers and hard drives; sophisticated air conditioning systems, redundancy power systems using batteries and generators, specialized fire suppression systems, and security personnel are all part of a typical data center.</p>
            <p>Internet Exchange Points IXP allow different ISPs to peer(interconnect) with one another in a shared facility, thereby improving performance for each partner in the peer relationship.</p>
            <p class="question">What kind of jobs are available in web development? That is, describe the broad jobs categories within web development</p>
